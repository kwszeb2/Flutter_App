Purpose of this project was to learn mobile development as well as the Dart language and build applications

My main focus on this project was the following:
- Make models for Product & Contact page
- Populate products from a JSON list & display the results
- Get familiar with User Interface(UI) design

Here are a few screenshots of the final result.
